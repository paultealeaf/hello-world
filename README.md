# hello-world

Hello people!

Paul here. I like Python, JavaScript, VBA, C#, and C++ for programming.  (Python is my favorite!)  Wordpress is always fun too.
I usually make exhibits for muesums in my free time.  My day job is as an expert analyst.
I love taking free courses on programming, making robots, and watching anime.
